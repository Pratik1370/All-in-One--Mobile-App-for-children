It is targeted for the preschool and kindergarten children. With the use of flash cards, numerous arenas are covered which ultimately help kids to easily grab different things in a visual and audio manner. Further, the testing and practice tool could make kids more interested in challenges and develop a feeling of accomplishing them.

         <h2> 2.0 Background of an application</h2>
         <hr/>
         <p style="margin-left:20px;margin-right:20px;">
        	 The current world is slowly moving towards the era of information technology. The practice of use of technology in teaching and learning is currently at peak and flourishing. Several researches even prove that the use of technology could be the best medium for children to learn and grab different information in no time.
        	 <br>
        	 According to <i>(Campbell et al. 2006)</i> , “for the most part, children learned to use the targeted device and gained competence in device use through practice.” The review paper clearly demonstrates how easily children grab the information which is imparted using technology. Further <i>(Bates, W. & Poole 2003)</i> also demonstrates the use of technology in higher education which clearly indicates how efficient is technology in field of teaching learning process.
        	 <br>
        	 Keeping these concepts in concern, the application <b>“All in one: Ultimate learning tool for kids”</b> is coined.

                          Of all kids learning apps. I would recommend this. There is a variety of games within this app, each targeting different learning skill. I used to be frustrated with other apps shapes matching games. My kid even rightly matching shape if would not place the item 100% on shadow the app would not accept. That creates doubt in my kid, Not in this app However. The app is intelligent and detects the kid rightfully selected the answer. And even if he wouldn't place 100% overlapping the shadow the answer is rewarded. This app is more intelligent than rest.

The advertisements on the game has adult content. It has army adds for a toddler to see guns is not ideal. Please review the adds first before showing in the game! The game was good but now ads pop up a lot!!! I didn’t need to remove the ads before now it basically forces you to remove ads.

<h3> Conclusion from Competitor's Analysis </h3>
<p style="margin-left:20px;margin-right:20px;">

The detailed study of competitor's analysis provided with the in depth idea about what an application should target to get the maximum audience presence.
It helped in analaysing, comparing and contrasting different applications and deriving the weak points in them and how a new proposed application can overcome those issues.
All in one: ultimate app for kids would be emphasing to provide the solution to the drawback of analysed application to get much audience coverage and interest.
The following things would be closely considered:
<ul>
<li> Unnecessary advertisements which would bother audiences wont be used.</li><p>
<li> The graphics, and layout would be much focused. </li><p>
<li> The app will be created user friendly and very easy to use.</li><p>
<li> No dead link will be used. </li><p>
<li> Thorough testing would be done to ensure all the functionalities are working properly</li><p>
<li> As the target audiences are kids, hence it would be made more interactive.</li><p>
<li> The contents of the application would be totally children centered.</li><p>
<li> Several updation schemes would be done to keep app's content updated.</li><p>
</ul>
